# **steg-fs: A Steganographic Filesystem for Windows**

## **Overview**
`steg-fs` is a novel filesystem that stores data by hiding it inside images using steganographic techniques. It presents itself as a virtual drive, allowing seamless file read/write operations while storing data in modified image files. The system includes encryption, integrity verification, and optional original file preservation.

## **Key Features**
✅ **Virtual Filesystem** – Mounts as a drive, allowing standard file operations.  
✅ **Steganographic Storage** – Uses image files (PNG, BMP, etc.) as the backend storage medium.  
✅ **Configurable Data Encoding** – Supports modifying either the least significant bit (LSB) or two least significant bits (2-LSB) of RGB(A) values.  
✅ **Strong Encryption** – AES-GCM or ChaCha20-Poly1305 encryption to protect hidden data.  
✅ **Error Detection & Correction** – Ensures data integrity using checksums, parity bits, or Reed-Solomon error correction.  
✅ **Filesystem Recovery Tool** – Scans images and reconstructs the filesystem in case of corruption.  
✅ **Secure File Wiping** – Implements safe deletion to prevent data recovery.  
✅ **Optional Original File Restoration** – Ability to store original image data separately for lossless restoration.  
✅ **Windows-Only** – Designed specifically for the Windows operating system.

## **Project Architecture**
`steg-fs` is structured into multiple Rust crates, each handling a core aspect of the filesystem:

### 1️⃣ **Image Encoding Crate (`steg-img-encode`)**
- Encodes base64 data into RGB(A) image pixels using LSB techniques.
- Supports configurable bit-depth modification (1-bit or 2-bit per color channel).
- Encrypts data before embedding.

### 2️⃣ **Filesystem Driver Crate (`steg-fs-driver`)**
- Intercepts file read/write operations.
- Interfaces with the storage management crate to allocate space and retrieve data.
- Uses WinFSP to expose the filesystem as a virtual drive in Windows.

### 3️⃣ **Image Decoding Crate (`steg-img-decode`)**
- Extracts hidden data from images.
- Verifies integrity using error detection codes.
- Decrypts extracted data.

### 4️⃣ **Image Writing Crate (`steg-img-write`)**
- Writes data into images while ensuring storage availability.
- Supports optional original file preservation mode.

### 5️⃣ **Filesystem Management Crate (`steg-fs-mgmt`)**
- Manages virtual filesystem metadata (file locations, sizes, available space).
- Handles secure file wiping.
- Implements recovery tools to scan for and rebuild lost files.

### 6️⃣ **Compression Crate (`steg-compress`)**
- Handles gzip compression/decompression.

### 7️⃣ **User Interface Crate (`steg-fs-ui`)**
- GUI/CLI for mounting, configuring, and managing `steg-fs`.
- Displays storage statistics and file mappings.

## **Installation & Usage**
(Instructions for installing dependencies, running the driver, and interacting with the filesystem will be added as development progresses.)
